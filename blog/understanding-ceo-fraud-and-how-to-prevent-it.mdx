CEO fraud is a type of cyber scam where criminals pretend to be a company’s CEO or another high-ranking executive. Their goal is to trick employees into sending money, revealing sensitive information, or granting access to company systems. These scams often rely on urgency and the trust employees place in leadership.

For example, an employee might receive an email from someone claiming to be the CEO, urgently requesting a wire transfer to a supplier. If the employee doesn’t verify the request, the money could be sent to the scammer’s account and be nearly impossible to recover.

## How Does CEO Fraud Work?

1. **Research**  
   Scammers learn about the company and its leadership. They might study the CEO’s email patterns, language style, and key business relationships.

2. **Impersonation**  
   Using this knowledge, they create fake emails or messages that look convincing. Sometimes, they even spoof email addresses to make them appear legitimate.

3. **Exploitation**  
   The scammer sends an urgent request, often asking for money transfers or sensitive information. They rely on employees’ hesitation to question senior executives.

## How to Recognize CEO Fraud

1. **Unusual Requests**  
   Be cautious of unexpected demands for payments, access credentials, or confidential data.

2. **Urgency**  
   If the email pressures you to act quickly or keep the matter secret, take a step back and verify.

3. **Inconsistent Details**  
   Look for minor errors in the email, such as slight changes in the sender’s address or tone that doesn’t match the executive’s usual style.

## Steps to Prevent CEO Fraud

1. **Educate Employees**  
   Ensure everyone knows what CEO fraud is and how it works. Regular training can help staff recognize red flags.

2. **Verify Requests**  
   Always double-check unusual requests, especially those involving money or sensitive information. Call or message the supposed sender using a known contact method.

3. **Implement Processes**  
   Set up approval processes for financial transactions and data access. For example, require two people to approve large transfers.

4. **Secure Communication**  
   Use secure channels for internal communications. Avoid discussing sensitive matters over email whenever possible.

5. **Monitor for Threats**  
   Watch for phishing attempts and other suspicious activity. Cybersecurity tools can help flag potential risks.

## What to Do If It Happens

If you suspect CEO fraud:  
- Stop and verify the request immediately.  
- Notify your cybersecurity team or IT department.  
- Report the incident to your company’s leadership and, if necessary, law enforcement.  
- Review your processes to identify gaps and prevent future attacks.

## Conclusion

CEO fraud is a growing threat, but it’s preventable with awareness and strong security practices. By staying vigilant and fostering a culture of verification, companies can protect themselves from falling victim to this type of scam. Remember: when in doubt, always double-check.
